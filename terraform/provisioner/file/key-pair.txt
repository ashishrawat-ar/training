how to create key-pair (public-key, private-key) using ssh gen

# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 

By default, the above command will generate the public as well as private key at location ‘/home//.ssh’

But we can override with a custom path : /home/ashish.rawat/training/keys/aws/aws_key

then enter and enter  (skip passphrase)

we use public-key.pub inside terrform script
private-key use for ssh purpose, so that we can login into our aws machine once it starts
